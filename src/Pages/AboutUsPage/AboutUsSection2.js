            Before things get too heated, let us jump in and say that both sides make valid points.
            Using real content during design can distract designers and design review teams alike away from the design,
            and insisting on always using publication-ready content can be a real drag on the design process.
            On the other hand, if you use poorly formatted filler text you may get a completely false
            sense of how your design will interact with real content. We propose a compromise: Only use filler
            text that has been edited for length and format to match the characteristics of real content as closely as possible,
            and use real content where possible, and where it doesn’t create too much distraction.
            Relax and do whatever fits with your design process. Don’t set a lot of restrictive hard-and-fast rules. 
            Use filler text where it helps your design process, but use real content if you’ve got it, 
            as long as it doesn’t distract and slow down your design process. Design is an evolutionary process, 
            and filler text is just one tool in your progress-pushing arsenal. Use it where it makes sense to use it, 
            and pull it once the natural process indicates that it’s time to
            roll out a descendant built with real content.<pre><a href="https://placeholder.com/text/">placeholder.com</a></pre>
